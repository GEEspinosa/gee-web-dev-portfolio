# Attrition: The Super War Card Game!

Welcome to **Attrition**, a React-based implementation of a classic war-style card game with added mechanics for war resolution, scoring, and strategic deck management. This game challenges two players to outwit each other by drawing cards, filling war piles, and managing reserves — all wrapped in a slick UI with theme and mode toggles. 

**This is a work in progress**

<h2 id="about">About</h2>

Attrition is a turn-based two-player card game inspired by the classic "War" card game. Players draw cards from their decks and compete by rank, initiating "wars" when ties occur. The app tracks scores, deck states, war phases, and provides visual feedback with modals and logs.

Designed as a React single-page application, it demonstrates complex state management, custom hooks, keyboard controls, and modal interactions — all while maintaining a clean and responsive UI.
